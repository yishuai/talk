提供详细的背景信息

“Given the following information about me, write a 4 paragraph college essay: I am originally from Barcelona, Spain. While my childhood had different traumatic events, such as the death of my father when I was only 6, I still think I had quite a happy childhood.. During my childhood, I changed schools very often, and attended all kinds of schools, from public schools to very religious private ones. One of the most “exotic” things I did during those years is to spend a full school year studying 6th grade in Twin Falls, Idaho, with my extended family.

I started working very early on. My first job, as an English teacher, was at age 13. After that, and throughout my studies, I worked as a teacher, waiter, and even construction worker.”*

# 行为面试问题

## 使用 STAR 格式回答行为面试问题

## 情况、任务、行动和结果

# 行为面试示例

- 你的弱点是什么？
- 不只回答自己弱点，而是基于自己的经历，采用 STAR 格式来回答。如：
  - 我的一个弱点是过于注重细节。我花了太多时间来审查产品的质量
  - 作为检查员，我对我们发布的产品的质量负责
  - 我后来意识到检查花费了太多时间，因此，我创建了一个自动化的数字检查程序，来执行这些重复的流程
  - 结果，产品检查时间缩短了 60%

Draft Interview Questions Using an AI Chatbot
In ChatGPT or your favorite AI chatbot, cut and paste the following prompt to help you draft questions for an interview of a new teacher, administrator, or school leader. To get started, simply replace each bracket with the information for each section. To ensure candidate privacy, do not include any personally identifiable information in your prompt.

You are an expert school leader, highly skilled in recruitment, employee management and retainment, decision making, organization, and interview skills. Your task is to draft 10-15 questions for a potential first grade Head Teacher for my K-12, all-girls', independent school that emphasizes community, joyful discovery, and life-long learning. The candidate is coming in for a first-round panel interview for a 8th grade Math teaching role. They have 5 years of previous teaching experience as an assistant teacher at a co-ed, public school with experience in middle school math teaching.

Interview Questions Prompt

You are an expert school leader, highly skilled in recruitment, employee management and retainment, decision making, organization, and interview skills. Your task is to draft [NUMBER] questions for a potential [CANDIDATE ROLE] for my [ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION] that emphasizes [OPTIONAL SPECIFICATION]. The candidate is coming in for [INTERVIEW TYPE / DESCRIPTION] for [ROLE]. They have [INSERT PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE INFORMATION].

Example Prompt

You are an expert school leader, highly skilled in recruitment, employee management and retainment, decision making, organization, and interview skills. Your task is to draft 10-15 questions for a potential first grade Head Teacher for my K-12, all-girls', independent school that emphasizes community, joyful discovery, and life-long learning. The candidate is coming in for a first-round panel interview for a 8th grade Math teaching role. They have 5 years of previous teaching experience as an assistant teacher at a co-ed, public school with experience in middle school math teaching.

Additional Prompting Strategies

Have the chatbot adapt the prompt for any type of interview. For example, specify a different type of role (such as a Department Chair, Dean, etc.), or a different type of interview (such as a phone screening, or a joint interview with two teachers who would be working together).

If you work at a certain type of school or there are particularly important aspects of your institution's mission, make sure to include that information in the prompt.

Ask the chatbot to help you conduct pre- and post- interview tasks, such as emailing candidates. Ask the chatbot, "Draft a brief, professional yet friendly email to a candidate who interviewed letting them know they will not be moving forward in the process."
