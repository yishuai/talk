# 反馈的意义

犯错误可以帮助学生学习，特别是就这些错误提供反馈

持续的、量身定制的反馈很重要，但实施起来也很耗时

# 及时结构化反馈

有效的练习，它需要一个计划，以及一个能够持续提供反馈和指导的教练

AI 教练，提供及时的鼓励、指导和刻意练习的其他要素

就像一位导师在练习者的每一步注视着他，推动他走向卓越

It requires a plan, as well as a coach who can continually provide feedback and mentorship.

相反，Raj 将人工智能驱动的建筑设计助手集成到他的工作流程中。每次他创建设计时，人工智能都会提供即时反馈。它可以突出结构效率低下，建议基于可持续材料的改进，甚至预测潜在成本。此外，人工智能还可以将 Raj 的设计与其他创新建筑作品的庞大数据库进行比较，突出差异并提出需要改进的地方。 Raj 不只是迭代设计，而是在每个项目之后进行结构化反思，这要归功于人工智能的见解。

Raj, conversely, integrates an AI-driven architectural design assistant into his workflow. Each time he creates a design, the AI provides instantaneous feedback. It can highlight structural inefficiencies, suggest improvements based on sustainable materials, and even predict potential costs. Moreover, the AI offers comparisons between Raj’s designs and a vast database of other innovative architectural works, highlighting differences and suggesting areas of improvement. Instead of just iterating designs, Raj engages in a structured reflection after every project, thanks to the insights from the AI. It’s akin to having a mentor watching over his shoulder at every step, nudging him toward excellence.

持续向众多学生提供个性化反馈所需的时间和精力可能令人望而生畏

然而，在指导和监督下，其中一些工作可以转移到

Theory: Making mistakes can help students learn. particularly if those mistakes are followed by feedback tailored to the individual student (Metcalfe, 2012). To be effective, that feedback should be timely and goal-oriented, helping students achieve their objectives. It should present a balanced overview of a student's performance, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, it must be actionable, empowering students to act and improve their work. Effective feedback pinpoints gaps and errors, and offers explanations about what students should do to improve (Wiliam, 2011).

Researchers note the significance of incorporating feedback into the broader learning process, as opposed to providing it at the conclusion of a project, test, or assignment. Providing feedback at regular intervals throughout the learning journey facilitates timely course corrections, maximizing potential for improvement (Wiggins, 2015). When feedback is coupled with practice it creates an environment that helps students learn (Mccrea, 2023).

Effective feedback connects the gap between students' current abilities and the intended learning outcomes. It has three components: feed-up, feedback, and feed-forward. Feed-up serves to clearly articulate the goals and expectations students are to meet. Feedback reflects students' current progress and pinpoints areas requiring further development; it provides actionable advice, helping students to achieve their goals. Feed-forward helps teachers plan and tweak their lessons based on student work. (Kirschner, & Neelen, 2018).

While ongoing, tailored feedback is important, it is difficult and time-consuming to implement in a large class setting. The time and effort required to consistently provide personalized feedback to numerous students can be daunting. With guidance and oversight however, some of that work can shift to the AI. 

Provide Students Feedback

Paste student work into ChatGPT and give it specific prompts for how you want to respond.

Tip, if I ask students a question in Google Forms and then review the responses in Google Sheets I can create a column that uses a formula to concatenate my ChatGPT prompt with the students response. The formula might look like

=”Give this student feedback on what they did well to the prompt and give specific tips for how to improve their response. The prompt: “&C1″&” and the students response “&C2
