appeal to Emotion
In ads for Michelin tires, a picture of a baby is shown with the words “because so much is riding on your tires.”

Analysis If we can consider this an argument at all, it has the form

Premise:
You love your baby.
Conclusion:
You should buy Michelin tires.

The advertisers hope that the love you feel for a baby will make you want to buy their tires. This attempt to evoke an emotional response as a tool of persuasion rep- resents the fallacy of appeal to emotion. 

Figure 1.6 shows its form when the emotional response is positive. 

p is associated with a positive emotional response; therefore ... p is true

Sometimes the appeal is to negative emotions. For example, the statement if my opponent is elected, your tax burden will rise tries to convince you that electing the other candidate will lead to consequences you won’t like. (In this negative form, the fallacy is sometimes called appeal to force.)

Personal attack

Gwen: You should stop drinking because it’s hurting your grades, endangering people when you drink and drive, and destroying your relationship with your family.
Merle: I’ve seen you drink a few too many on occasion yourself!
Analysis Gwen’s argument is well reasoned, with premises offering strong support for her conclusion that Merle should stop drinking. Merle rejects this argument by noting that Gwen sometimes drinks too much herself. 

Even if Merle’s claim is true, it is ir- relevant to Gwen’s point. Merle has resorted to attacking Gwen personally rather than arguing logically, so we call this fallacy personal attack (Figure 1.7). (It is also called ad hominem, Latin for “to the person.”)

I have a problem with the person or group claiming p.
p is not true.

The fallacy of personal attack can also apply to groups. For example, someone might say, “This new bill will be an environmental disaster because its sponsors re- ceived large campaign contributions from oil companies.” This ---argument is fallacious because it doesn’t challenge the provisions of the 
bill, but only questions the motives of the sponsors.  Now try 练习 17.

Time Out to Think A person’s (or group’s) character, circumstances, and motives oc- casionally are logically relevant to an argument. That is why, for example, witnesses in criminal cases often are asked questions about their personal lives. If you were a judge, how would you decide when to allow such questions?

ExAMPLE 8 Circular reasoning

“Society has an obligation to provide health insurance because health care is a right of citizenship.”

Analysis This argument states the conclusion (society has an obligation to provide health insurance) before the premise (health care is a human right). But if you read carefully, you’ll recognize that the premise and the conclusion both say essentially the same thing, as social obligations are generally based on definitions of accepted rights. This argument therefore suffers from circular reasoning (Figure 1.8). 

p is true. 用不同的话，反复说

ExAMPLE 9 Diversion (red herring)

“We should not continue to fund cloning research because there are so many ethical issues involved. Decisions are based on ethics, and we cannot afford to have too many ethical loose ends.”

Analysis The argument begins with its conclusion—we should not continue to fund clon- ing research. However, the discussion is all about ethics. This argument represents the fallacy of diversion (Figure 1.9) because it attempts to divert attention from the real issue (funding for cloning research) by focusing on another issue (ethics). 

p is related to q and I have an argument concerning q; therefore ...
p is true.

The issue to which attention is diverted is sometimes called a red herring. (A herring is a fish that turns red when rotten. Use of the term red herring to mean a diversion can be traced back to the 19th century, when British fugitives discovered that they could divert bloodhounds from their pursuit by rubbing a red herring across their trail.) Note that personal attacks (see Example 7) are often used as diversions.

ExAMPLE 10 Straw Man
Suppose that the mayor of a large city proposes decriminalizing drug possession in order to reduce overcrowding in jails and save money on enforcement. His challenger in the upcoming election says, “The mayor doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with drug use, but I do.”
Analysis The mayor did not say that drug use is acceptable. His proposal for decrimi- nalization is designed to solve another problem—overcrowding of jails—and tells us nothing about his general views on drug use. The speaker has distorted the mayor’s views. Any argument based on a distortion of someone’s words or beliefs is called a straw man (Figure 1.10). The term comes from the idea that the speaker has used a poor representation of a person’s beliefs in the same way that a straw man is a poor rep- resentation of a real man. A straw man is similar to a diversion. The primary difference is that a diversion argues against an unrelated issue, while the straw man argues against a distorted version of the real issue.

Evaluating Media information
The fallacies we’ve discussed represent only a small sample of the many tactics used by in- dividuals, groups, and companies seeking to shape your opinions. There are no foolproof ways to be sure that a particular piece of media information is reliable. However, there are a few guidelines, summarized in the following box, that can be helpful. Keep these ideas in mind not only as you evaluate media information, but also as you continue your study in this course. As you will see, much of the rest of this book is devoted to learning to evaluate quantitative information using the same general criteria given in the box.

Five Steps to Evaluating Media information
1. Consider the source. Is the source of the information clear? Does the source have credibility on this issue?
2. Check the date. Can you determine when the information was written? Is it still relevant, or is it outdated?
3. Validate accuracy. Can you validate the information from other sources? Do you have good reason to believe it is accurate? Does it contain anything that makes you suspicious?
4. Watch for hidden agendas. Is the information presented fairly and objectively, or is it manipulated to serve some particular or hidden agenda?
5. Don’t miss the big picture. Even if a piece of media information passes all the above tests, step back and consider whether it makes sense. For example, does it conflict with other things you think are true, and if so, how can you resolve the conflict?

示例：

Mars in the night Sky
Evaluate the Mars claim from the chapter opener: “On August 27, Mars will look as large and
bright as the full Moon. Don’t miss it, because no one alive today will ever see this again.” Analysis Let’s apply the five steps for evaluating media information:
1. Consider the source. The original source of the claim is not given, which means you have no way to know if the source is authoritative. This should make you sus- picious of the claim.
2. Check the date. Although the claim sounds specific in citing August 27 for the event, no year is given, so you have no way to know if the claim is intended to apply to this year, every year, or a particular past or future year. This should increase your concern about the claim.
3. Validate accuracy. The claim is easy to look up, and you’ll find numerous websites stating that it is untrue. Of course, you should also check the validity of these web- sites before believing them, but you’ll find some are reliable sources such as NASA or well-respected news sites. We therefore conclude that the correct answer to the chapter-opening question is D—the claim is false. But let’s continue with the last two steps anyway.
4. Watchforhiddenagendas.Inthiscase,there’snoobvioushiddenagenda.Itseems more likely that the claim is just a misstatement of fact. Additional research will

show that the claim originally arose in 2003, when on August 27 Mars came slightly closer to Earth than it will come again for at least 200 years. However, Mars was still nowhere near as large and bright in our sky as the full Moon.
5. Don’t miss the big picture. This step asks us to stand back and think about whether the claim make sense, which you can do by thinking about the hint in the chapter opener: Mars is a planet orbiting the Sun, while the Moon orbits Earth. This fact means that the Moon is always much closer to us than Mars; in fact, even at its closest, Mars is about 150 times as far from Earth as the Moon. You can then conclude that Mars could never appear as large and bright in our sky as the full Moon. (If you want to be more quantitative: At 150 times the distance of the Moon, Mars would have to be 150 times as large as the Moon in diameter in order to appear equally large in our sky. However, Mars is only about twice as large in diameter as the Moon.)  Now try Exercises 21–24.

25–40: recognizing Fallacies. In the following arguments, identify the premise(s) and conclusion, explain why the argument is decep- tive, and, if possible, identify the type of fallacy it represents.
25. Obesity among Americans has increased steadily, as has the sale of video games. It follows that video games are compro- mising the health of Americans.
26. The polls show the Republican candidate leading by a 2-to-1 margin, so you should vote for the Republican.
27. All the mayors of my hometown have been men, which shows that men are better qualified for high office than women.
28. My father tells me that I should exercise daily. But he never exer- cised when he was young, so I see no need to follow his advice.
29. My baby was vaccinated and later developed autism, which is why I believe that vaccines cause autism.
30. The state has no right to take a life, so the death penalty should be abolished.
31. Everyone loves Shakespeare, because his plays have been read for many centuries.
32. Claims that GMO foods are unsafe are ridiculous, as I’ve never heard of anyone getting sick from them.
33. I will not give money to the earthquake relief effort. After I last gave to a charity, an audit showed that most of the money was used to pay its administrators in the front office.
34. It’s not surprising that President Obama’s budget contains spend- ing increases. Democrats don’t care about taxpayers’ money.
35. The Congressperson is a member of the National Rifle Association, so I’m sure she will not support a ban on assault rifles.
36. My three friends who drink wine have never had heart attacks. My two friends who have had heart attacks are non-drinkers. Drinking wine is clearly a good therapy.

37. Responding to Republicans who want to end the estate tax, which falls most heavily on the wealthy, a Democrat says, “The Republicans think that rich people aren’t rich enough.”
38. The Wyoming toad has not been seen outside of captivity since 2002, so it must be extinct in the wild.
39. My little boy loves dolls and my little girl loves trucks, so there’s no truth to the claim that boys are more interested in mechanical toys while girls prefer maternal toys.
40. Responding to Democrats who want to raise the fuel effi- ciency standards for new cars and trucks, a Republican says, “Democrats think that government is the solution to all our problems ....
41–44: Additional Fallacies. Consider the following fallacies (which are not discussed in the text). Explain why the fallacy applies to the ex- ample and create your own argument that displays the same fallacy.
41. The fallacy of division has this form:
Premise: 
X has some property.
Conclusion:
All things or people that belong to X must have the same property.
Example:
Americans use more gasoline than Europeans, so Jake, who is an American, must use more gasoline than Europeans.
42. The gambler’s fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X has been happening more than it should. 
Conclusion: 
X will come to an end soon.
Example:
It has rained for 10 days, which is unusual around here. Tomorrow will be sunny.
43. The slippery slope fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X has occurred and is related to Y.
Conclusion: 
Y will inevitably occur.
Example:
America has sent troops to three countries recently. Before you know it, we will have troops everywhere.
44. The middle ground fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X and Y are two extreme positions on a question. 
Conclusion: 
Z, which lies between X and Y, must be correct. 
Example:
Senator Peters supports a large tax cut, and Senator Willis supports no tax cut. That means a small tax cut must be best.
