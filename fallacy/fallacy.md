# 第一讲：逻辑谬误

## Mathematics is just logic with numbers attached. 

Marilyn vos Savant, Author

---
# 媒体时代

- 物理媒体：书籍、报纸、杂志和广告牌
- 电子媒体：互联网、平板电脑和智能手机、电视、电影
- 我们依赖这些媒体来源获取信息，形成观点和信念

---
# 挑战

- 媒体中的许多信息不准确、有偏见
- 其目的是让我们“相信”某些事
- 这些事可能真实，也可能不真实

---
# 逻辑

- 了解人们试图操纵我们观点的方式
- 这是“基于数据的逻辑推理”的基础

---

# 吵架还是争论？

## People generally quarrel because they cannot argue.

G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936), English author

quarrel：吵架

---
# 没有逻辑的争论

- A：过量的碳排放是不道德的
- B：不，不是
- A：是的！它会让气候变暖
- B：你都不懂气候是如何变暖的
- A：我知道的比你知道的多！
- B：我不能和你谈。你简直就是一个白痴！

---
# 没有逻辑的争论的问题

- 效果一般
- 不会让任何一方理解对方的想法
- 也不太可能改变任何一方的观点

---
# 有逻辑的争论

- 使用逻辑（Logic）
  - 学习推理方法和原则
- 可能仍不会改变任何一方的立场
- 但可以帮助我们相互理解

---
# 逻辑基本概念

- “论证”（Argument）
  - 推理或思考的过程
- “前提”（Premise）
  - 支持结论（conclusion）的事实或假设（证据）
- “谬误”（Fallacy）
  - 一种“欺骗”或“诡计”式的论证
  - 它采取的论证方式，仔细分析后，会发现不合理

### 常见谬误

- 诉诸流行
- 虚假原因
- 诉诸未知
- 草率概括
- 有限选择
- 诉诸情感
- 人身攻击
- 循环推理
- 转移视线
- 稻草人

---
# 诉诸流行

- Appeal to Popularity

- “长城汽车制造了世界上最好的皮卡车。开长城皮卡的人比开任何其他轻型卡车的人都多。”

- 分析
  - 第一步：识别哪些陈述句是“前提”（证据），哪些是“结论”
  - 论点：长城制造了世界上最好的皮卡
  - 证据：驾驶长城皮卡的人比驾驶其他任何轻型卡车的人都多

- 许多人相信 p 是真的；因此 ... p 为真

???
# 练习

(Appeal to popularity) 

Apple’s iPhone outsells all other smart phones, so it must be the best smart phone on the market.

---
# 练习

（诉诸流行）

Apple 的 iPhone 销量超过所有其他智能手机，因此它一定是市场上最好的智能手机。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 虚假原因

- False Cause
- “我把水晶石放在额头上，五分钟后我的头痛就消失了。是水晶让我的头痛消失了。”
- 分析
  - 一件事（额头上放水晶）先于另一件事（头痛消失）发生，
  - 但并没有证明它们之间有任何联系。也就是说，我们不能断定水晶使头痛消失
- A 先于 B；因此 A 导致了 B

???
# 练习

(False cause) 

I became sick just hours after eating at Burger Hut, so its food must have made me sick.

---
# 练习

（虚假原因）

在 Burger Hut 吃了几个小时后我就生病了，所以它的食物一定让我生病了。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 诉诸未知

- Appeal to ignorance
- “科学家们还没有发现任何外星人访问地球的具体证据。所以
外星人不存在”
- 分析
  - 前提：没有证据表明外星人访问过地球
  - 结论：外星人不存在
- 利用对结论的未知，得出相反的结论
  - 没有证据表明 p 是真的；因此 p 为假
- 缺乏证据并不是“否命题”的证据

???
# 练习

(Appeal to ignorance) 

Decades of searching have not revealed life on other planets, so life in the universe must be confined to Earth.

---
# 练习

（诉诸无知）

数十年的搜寻并没有发现其他行星上的生命，因此宇宙中的生命必定局限在地球上。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 讨论

- 一个人被判无罪，能证明这个人无辜吗？为什么？
- 为什么法律要求检察官证明有罪，而不要求被告（嫌疑人）证明无罪？
- 这个想法与诉诸无知的谬误有什么关系？

---
# 草率概括

- Hasty generalization
- “高压电线所在街道发生了两起儿童白血病病例。电源线一定是这些疾病的原因。”
- 分析
  - 前提是两个白血病病例，但是两个病例都不足以建立一个规律，更不能断定是电源线引起的病症
- 根据数量不足或未充分分析的案例得出结论
  - 要证明电力线与白血病之间存在联系，必须用多得多的证据来证实。（事实上​​，数十年的研究并未发现电线与疾病之间存在关联。）
- A和B连接了一次或几次；因此 A 导致 B（反之亦然）

???
# 练习

(Hasty generalization) 

I saw three people use food stamps to buy expensive steaks, so abuse of food stamps must be widespread.

---
# 练习

（草率概括）

我看到那个乞讨的人拿我给他的钱买昂贵的牛排，所以这些乞讨的人都是骗子。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 有限选择

- Limited Choice
- “你不支持班长，所以你不爱我们班。”
- 分析
  - 该论点表明只有两种类型的同学：支持班长的爱班级的同学，不支持班长的不爱班级的同学
  - 但实际上还有很多其他的可能性，比如爱班级但不爱班长
- 这种谬误被称为有限选择（或虚假的困境），因为它人为地排除了其它可以考虑的选择

---
# 有限选择

- 也会出现在“你戒烟了吗？”之类的问题中
  - 是和否的答案都暗示您过去曾吸烟
  - 该问题排除了您从不吸烟的可能性
- 在法律诉讼中，这类问题是不允许的，因为它们试图“引导证人”
- 这种谬误的另一种简单而常见的形式是“你错了，所以我一定是对的”
- p 是假的；因此...只有 q 可以为真

???
# 练习

(Limited choice) 

He refused to testify by invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, so he must be guilty.

---
# 练习

（有限选择）

他拒绝为自己辩护，因此他一定有罪。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 诉诸情感

- Appeal to Emotion
- 汽车轮胎广告，一张婴儿的照片，写着“因为你的轮胎承受了太多的压力”
- 分析
  - 前提：你爱你的孩子
  - 结论：你应该买我这个轮胎
- 广告商希望你对婴儿的爱会让你想买他们的轮胎
  - 唤起情绪反应，作为说服的工具。这是诉诸情绪的谬误
- p与积极的情绪反应相关；因此... p 为真

---
# 诉诸情感
- 有时诉诸的是负面情绪
- 例如，竞选班长，声明：如果对手当选，同学们的福利会减少
  - 试图说服你相信，选择另一位候选人，将导致不喜欢的后果
- 这种谬误有时被称为诉诸强力（appeal to force）

???
# 练习

(Appeal to emotion) 

Thousands of unarmed people, many of them children, are killed by firearms every year. It’s time we ban the sale of guns.

---
# 练习

（诉诸情感）

每年有数以千计的人死于交通事故，其中许多是可爱的儿童。是时候禁止汽车了。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 人身攻击

- Personal attack
  - A：你应该戒酒，因为它会影响你的成绩，酒后驾车时会危及他人，还会破坏你与家人的关系
  - B：你自己有时也喝得很多！
- 分析
  - A 的论点有充分理由，前提为结论提供了强有力支持
  - B 驳斥了这一论点，指出 A 有时自己喝得太多了
  - 即使 B 的说法是正确的，它也与 A 的观点无关
  - B 对 A 进行人身攻击，而不是逻辑争论
- 我对声称 p 的人或团体有意见 ... p 不是真的
  - 拉丁语 ad hominem，意思是“针对个人”

---
# 人身攻击
- 人身攻击的谬误也适用于集体
- 例如：“这项提案将带来环境灾难，因为它的发起人收到了石油公司的资助。”
- 它没有挑战提案，只质疑资助人的动机
- 这个论证不成立

???
# 练习

(Personal attack) 

Senator Smith’s bill on agricultural policy is a sham, because he is supported by companies that sell genetically modified crop seeds.

---
# 练习

（人身攻击）

他的这个提案是一个骗局，因为他得到了销售这个种子的公司的资助。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 思考（人身攻击）

- 为什么刑事案件中的证人经常被问到关于他们个人生活的问题
  - 一个人（或群体）的性格、环境和动机有时在逻辑上与论点相关
- 如果你是一名法官，你会如何决定何时允许此类问题？

---
# 循环推理

- Circular reasoning
- “社会有义务提供医疗保险，因为医疗保健是公民的权利。”
- 分析 
  - 前提和结论本质上是同一件事
  - 社会义务通常基于公认权利的定义
- 循环推理
  - p 是真的。 用不同的话，反复说

???
# 练习

(Circular reasoning) 

Illegal immigration is against the law, so illegal immigrants are criminals.

---
# 练习

（循环推理）

非法移民是违法的，所以非法移民是罪犯。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 转移视线（红鲱鱼）

- Diversion (red herring)
- “我们不应该继续资助克隆研究，因为这种研究是关乎道德的，我们不能涉及太多道德问题。”
- 分析 
  - 争论：应不应该继续资助克隆研究
  - 然而，讨论都是关于道德的
- 通过关注另一个问题（道德）来转移对真正问题（资助克隆研究）的注意力
  - p 与 q 有关，我对 q 有疑义；所以 ... p 是真实的
- 有时被称为“转移注意力”

---
# 转移视线（红鲱鱼）

- 鲱鱼是一种在腐烂时会变红的鱼
- 19 世纪，英国逃犯发现通过在逃跑路线上擦红鲱鱼，可以转移猎犬的跟踪
- 注意：人身攻击也常用来转移注意力

???
# 练习

(Diversion) 

Good grades are needed to get into college, and a college diploma is necessary for a good career. Therefore, attendance should count in high school grades.

---
# 练习

（转移视线）

上大学需要一份好的高中成绩，找到一份好工作需要一个大学文凭。因此，出勤率应计入高中成绩。

<!-- 举一个生活中的例子 -->

---
# 稻草人

- 同学 A：放开“路边摆摊”，可以减少人们经营成本，促进大众就业
- 同学 B：这位同学不认为“路边摆摊”有什么问题，但我认为 ...
- 分析
  - 同学 A 的提议是要解决大众就业
  - 她并没有说她对路边摆摊的一般看法
  - 同学 B 歪曲了同学 A 的观点
  - 她立了一个稻草人，用它代表和同学 A 的思想有关的一个不合理的表现
- 这种扭曲他人言论或提议的争论被称为“稻草人”

---
# 稻草人
- 稻草人类似于转移注意力
- 主要区别在于
  - 转移注意力，转移到一个不相关的问题
  - 稻草人，转移到真实问题的一个扭曲的版本
- 我有一个关于 p 的扭曲版本的论点；所以 ... 我希望愚弄你，让你相信我关于 p 的真实版本的论点

???
# 练习

(Straw man) 

The mayor wants to raise taxes to fund social programs, so she must not believe in the value of hard work.

# 评估媒体信息的五个步骤

- 考虑信源
  - 信息来源是否清楚？消息来源在这个问题上是否可信？
- 检查日期
  - 信息是什么时候写的？它现在仍然相关，还是已经过时？
- 验证准确性
  - 有没有其他信源？有充分理由相信它是准确的吗？它包含任何让你怀疑的东西吗？

# 评估媒体信息的五个步骤

- 注意隐藏的议程（agenda）
  - 信息是否公平客观地呈现，是否被操纵以服务于某些特定或隐藏的议程？
- 从更高的角度看（do not miss the big picture）
  - 即使一条媒体信息通过了上述所有测试，退一步，从更高的角度思考，它是否真的有意义？例如，它是否与您认为正确的其他事情有冲突，如果有，您如何解决它们之间的冲突？

# 示例

- 我们看到这样一个消息：
  - “8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”
- 用评估媒体信息的五个步骤来分析

---
# 1. 考虑消息来源

- 消息：“8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”

- 未给出原始来源，这意味着您无法知道来源是否权威
- 这应该会让你对这种说法产生怀疑

---
# 2. 检查日期

- 消息：“8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”

- 尽管该声明在引用该事件的 8 月 27 日时听起来很具体，但没有给出年份，因此您无法知道该声明是适用于今年、每一年，还是过去或未来的特定年份
- 这应该增加您对它的担忧

---
# 3. 搜索验证

- 消息：“8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”

- 该声明很容易在网上搜索相关信息验证，您会发现许多网站都表明它是不真实的。
- 当然，在相信这些网站之前，您还应该检查它们的有效性。但您会发现一些可靠的来源，例如国家天文台或备受推崇的新闻网站。
  - 然后，我们可以得出结论：该断言是错误的。但是无论如何，让我们继续最后两个步骤

---
# 4. 注意隐藏的议程

- 消息：“8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”

- 没有明显的隐藏议程，这种说法似乎更有可能只是对事实的错误陈述
- 进一步的研究将表明，这一说法最初出现于 2003 年，当时 8 月 27 日火星离地球的距离比它再次离地球的距离要近 200 年
- 然而，在我们的天空中，火星仍然远不及满月那么大，那么亮

---
# 5. 运用知识，思考其合理性

- 消息：“8 月 27 日，火星会像满月那么大，那么亮。不要错过它，因为今天活着的人再也不会看到它了。”

- 思考这个说法是否有道理
  - 火星是绕太阳公转的行星，而月球绕地球公转。所以月球总是比火星离我们近得多
  - 即使在离地球最近的地方，火星与地球的距离也是月球与地球的距离的 150 倍左右
  - 然而，火星的直径只有月球的两倍左右
- 所以，火星在我们的天空中永远不会像满月那样大而明亮

appeal to Emotion
In ads for Michelin tires, a picture of a baby is shown with the words “because so much is riding on your tires.”

Analysis If we can consider this an argument at all, it has the form

Premise:
You love your baby.
Conclusion:
You should buy Michelin tires.

The advertisers hope that the love you feel for a baby will make you want to buy their tires. This attempt to evoke an emotional response as a tool of persuasion rep- resents the fallacy of appeal to emotion. 

Figure 1.6 shows its form when the emotional response is positive. 

p is associated with a positive emotional response; therefore ... p is true

Sometimes the appeal is to negative emotions. For example, the statement if my opponent is elected, your tax burden will rise tries to convince you that electing the other candidate will lead to consequences you won’t like. (In this negative form, the fallacy is sometimes called appeal to force.)

Personal attack

Gwen: You should stop drinking because it’s hurting your grades, endangering people when you drink and drive, and destroying your relationship with your family.
Merle: I’ve seen you drink a few too many on occasion yourself!
Analysis Gwen’s argument is well reasoned, with premises offering strong support for her conclusion that Merle should stop drinking. Merle rejects this argument by noting that Gwen sometimes drinks too much herself. 

Even if Merle’s claim is true, it is ir- relevant to Gwen’s point. Merle has resorted to attacking Gwen personally rather than arguing logically, so we call this fallacy personal attack (Figure 1.7). (It is also called ad hominem, Latin for “to the person.”)

I have a problem with the person or group claiming p.
p is not true.

The fallacy of personal attack can also apply to groups. For example, someone might say, “This new bill will be an environmental disaster because its sponsors re- ceived large campaign contributions from oil companies.” This argument is fallacious because it doesn’t challenge the provisions of the 
bill, but only questions the motives of the sponsors.  Now try 练习 17.


Time Out to Think A person’s (or group’s) character, circumstances, and motives oc- casionally are logically relevant to an argument. That is why, for example, witnesses in criminal cases often are asked questions about their personal lives. If you were a judge, how would you decide when to allow such questions?

ExAMPLE 8 Circular reasoning

“Society has an obligation to provide health insurance because health care is a right of citizenship.”

Analysis This argument states the conclusion (society has an obligation to provide health insurance) before the premise (health care is a human right). But if you read carefully, you’ll recognize that the premise and the conclusion both say essentially the same thing, as social obligations are generally based on definitions of accepted rights. This argument therefore suffers from circular reasoning (Figure 1.8). 

p is true. 用不同的话，反复说

The fallacy of circular reasoning.


 Now try 练习 18.


ExAMPLE 9 Diversion (red herring)

“We should not continue to fund cloning research because there are so many ethical issues involved. Decisions are based on ethics, and we cannot afford to have too many ethical loose ends.”

Analysis The argument begins with its conclusion—we should not continue to fund clon- ing research. However, the discussion is all about ethics. This argument represents the fallacy of diversion (Figure 1.9) because it attempts to divert attention from the real issue (funding for cloning research) by focusing on another issue (ethics). 

p is related to q and I have an argument concerning q; therefore ...
p is true.

The issue to which attention is diverted is sometimes called a red herring. (A herring is a fish that turns red when rotten. Use of the term red herring to mean a diversion can be traced back to the 19th century, when British fugitives discovered that they could divert bloodhounds from their pursuit by rubbing a red herring across their trail.) Note that personal attacks (see Example 7) are often used as diversions.

ExAMPLE 10 Straw Man
Suppose that the mayor of a large city proposes decriminalizing drug possession in order to reduce overcrowding in jails and save money on enforcement. His challenger in the upcoming election says, “The mayor doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with drug use, but I do.”
Analysis The mayor did not say that drug use is acceptable. His proposal for decrimi- nalization is designed to solve another problem—overcrowding of jails—and tells us nothing about his general views on drug use. The speaker has distorted the mayor’s views. Any argument based on a distortion of someone’s words or beliefs is called a straw man (Figure 1.10). The term comes from the idea that the speaker has used a poor representation of a person’s beliefs in the same way that a straw man is a poor rep- resentation of a real man. A straw man is similar to a diversion. The primary difference is that a diversion argues against an unrelated issue, while the straw man argues against a distorted version of the real issue. 


 Now try 练习 20.


I have an argument concerning a distorted version of p; therefore ...
I hope you are fooled into concluding I have an argument concerning the real version of p.

Evaluating Media information
The fallacies we’ve discussed represent only a small sample of the many tactics used by in- dividuals, groups, and companies seeking to shape your opinions. There are no foolproof ways to be sure that a particular piece of media information is reliable. However, there are a few guidelines, summarized in the following box, that can be helpful. Keep these ideas in mind not only as you evaluate media information, but also as you continue your study in this course. As you will see, much of the rest of this book is devoted to learning to evaluate quantitative information using the same general criteria given in the box.

Five Steps to Evaluating Media information
1. Consider the source. Is the source of the information clear? Does the source have credibility on this issue?
2. Check the date. Can you determine when the information was written? Is it still relevant, or is it outdated?
3. Validate accuracy. Can you validate the information from other sources? Do you have good reason to believe it is accurate? Does it contain anything that makes you suspicious?
4. Watch for hidden agendas. Is the information presented fairly and objectively, or is it manipulated to serve some particular or hidden agenda?
5. Don’t miss the big picture. Even if a piece of media information passes all the above tests, step back and consider whether it makes sense. For example, does it conflict with other things you think are true, and if so, how can you resolve the conflict?

示例：

Mars in the night Sky
Evaluate the Mars claim from the chapter opener: “On August 27, Mars will look as large and
bright as the full Moon. Don’t miss it, because no one alive today will ever see this again.” Analysis Let’s apply the five steps for evaluating media information:
1. Consider the source. The original source of the claim is not given, which means you have no way to know if the source is authoritative. This should make you sus- picious of the claim.
2. Check the date. Although the claim sounds specific in citing August 27 for the event, no year is given, so you have no way to know if the claim is intended to apply to this year, every year, or a particular past or future year. This should increase your concern about the claim.
3. Validate accuracy. The claim is easy to look up, and you’ll find numerous websites stating that it is untrue. Of course, you should also check the validity of these web- sites before believing them, but you’ll find some are reliable sources such as NASA or well-respected news sites. We therefore conclude that the correct answer to the chapter-opening question is D—the claim is false. But let’s continue with the last two steps anyway.
4. Watchforhiddenagendas.Inthiscase,there’snoobvioushiddenagenda.Itseems more likely that the claim is just a misstatement of fact. Additional research will

show that the claim originally arose in 2003, when on August 27 Mars came slightly closer to Earth than it will come again for at least 200 years. However, Mars was still nowhere near as large and bright in our sky as the full Moon.
5. Don’t miss the big picture. This step asks us to stand back and think about whether the claim make sense, which you can do by thinking about the hint in the chapter opener: Mars is a planet orbiting the Sun, while the Moon orbits Earth. This fact means that the Moon is always much closer to us than Mars; in fact, even at its closest, Mars is about 150 times as far from Earth as the Moon. You can then conclude that Mars could never appear as large and bright in our sky as the full Moon. (If you want to be more quantitative: At 150 times the distance of the Moon, Mars would have to be 150 times as large as the Moon in diameter in order to appear equally large in our sky. However, Mars is only about twice as large in diameter as the Moon.)  Now try Exercises 21–24.

应用
25–40: recognizing Fallacies. In the following arguments, identify the premise(s) and conclusion, explain why the argument is decep- tive, and, if possible, identify the type of fallacy it represents.
25. Obesity among Americans has increased steadily, as has the sale of video games. It follows that video games are compro- mising the health of Americans.
26. The polls show the Republican candidate leading by a 2-to-1 margin, so you should vote for the Republican.
27. All the mayors of my hometown have been men, which shows that men are better qualified for high office than women.
28. My father tells me that I should exercise daily. But he never exer- cised when he was young, so I see no need to follow his advice.
29. My baby was vaccinated and later developed autism, which is why I believe that vaccines cause autism.
30. The state has no right to take a life, so the death penalty should be abolished.
31. Everyone loves Shakespeare, because his plays have been read for many centuries.
32. Claims that GMO foods are unsafe are ridiculous, as I’ve never heard of anyone getting sick from them.
33. I will not give money to the earthquake relief effort. After I last gave to a charity, an audit showed that most of the money was used to pay its administrators in the front office.
34. It’s not surprising that President Obama’s budget contains spend- ing increases. Democrats don’t care about taxpayers’ money.
35. The Congressperson is a member of the National Rifle Association, so I’m sure she will not support a ban on assault rifles.
36. My three friends who drink wine have never had heart attacks. My two friends who have had heart attacks are non-drinkers. Drinking wine is clearly a good therapy.

37. Responding to Republicans who want to end the estate tax, which falls most heavily on the wealthy, a Democrat says, “The Republicans think that rich people aren’t rich enough.”
38. The Wyoming toad has not been seen outside of captivity since 2002, so it must be extinct in the wild.
39. My little boy loves dolls and my little girl loves trucks, so there’s no truth to the claim that boys are more interested in mechanical toys while girls prefer maternal toys.
40. Responding to Democrats who want to raise the fuel effi- ciency standards for new cars and trucks, a Republican says, “Democrats think that government is the solution to all our problems ....
41–44: Additional Fallacies. Consider the following fallacies (which are not discussed in the text). Explain why the fallacy applies to the ex- ample and create your own argument that displays the same fallacy.
41. The fallacy of division has this form:
Premise: 
X has some property.
Conclusion:
All things or people that belong to X must have the same property.
Example:
Americans use more gasoline than Europeans, so Jake, who is an American, must use more gasoline than Europeans.
42. The gambler’s fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X has been happening more than it should. 
Conclusion: 
X will come to an end soon.
Example:
It has rained for 10 days, which is unusual around here. Tomorrow will be sunny.
43. The slippery slope fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X has occurred and is related to Y.
Conclusion: 
Y will inevitably occur.
Example:
America has sent troops to three countries recently. Before you know it, we will have troops everywhere.
44. The middle ground fallacy has this form:
Premise: 
X and Y are two extreme positions on a question. 
Conclusion: 
Z, which lies between X and Y, must be correct. 
Example:
Senator Peters supports a large tax cut, and Senator Willis supports no tax cut. That means a small tax cut must be best.

The skills discussed in the preceding units are all useful in their own right. But critical thinking involves much more than isolated skills. It also involves careful reading (or listening), sharp thinking, logical analysis, good visualization, healthy skepticism, and more.

Because it is so wide ranging, critical thinking cannot be described by any simple step-by-step procedure. Instead, it is developed through experience and by questioning and analyzing every argument or decision you face. Nevertheless, a few general guidelines or hints can be useful, and we will discuss a few in this unit.

hint 1: read (or listen) Carefully

Language can be used in complex ways that require careful effort to understand. Always read (or listen) carefully to make sure you’ve grasped precisely what was said. Also be sure that you’ve distinguished what was actually said, what was assumed, and what must be determined.

ExAMPLE 1 Confusing Ballot Wording

The following is the actual wording of a ballot question posed in 1992 to Colorado voters.

Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution to prohibit the state of Colorado and any of its political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing any law or policy which provides that homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, or relationships constitutes or entitles a person to claim any minority or protected status, quota preferences, or discrimination?

Explain the meaning of yes and no votes.

Solution Thelegalisticwordingofthequestionmakesitdifficulttoseethekeypoint. But on careful reading, the question essentially asks: Should the state prohibit laws that grant gay people minority status or protection from discrimination? Even in this simplified form, the question may be confusing because it is asked in negative terms: A yes vote is a vote against gay rights, while a no vote is a vote for gay rights. Some evidence suggests that the wording confused voters. Pre-election polls indicated that the proposed amendment would be defeated. However, the amendment passed, which means either that the polls were inaccurate or that voters were confused and voted opposite to their beliefs.  Now try Exercises 11–24.

Time Out to Think If voters really did misunderstand the wording of the Colorado ballot initiative, would the confusion have affected both sides equally, or would it have favored one side more than the other? Defend your opinion.

hint 2: look for hidden assumptions

The arguments we studied in Unit 1D consisted of clear premises leading to the conclusion. Many real arguments lack such clarity, relying instead on ambiguous terms or hidden assumptions. Often, the speaker (or writer) may think these premises are “obvious,” but listeners (or readers) may not agree. Indeed, an argument that seems convincing to the speaker may actually be quite weak to a listener who is not aware of the hidden assumptions.

By ThE WAy

Despite passing, the Colorado amendment never took effect, and in 1996 it was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices said the amendment denied gays a political right enjoyed by everyone else—the chance to seek protection from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.

ExAMPLE 2 Building More Prisons Analyze the following argument:

We should build more prisons because incarcerating more criminals will reduce the crime rate.

Solution This argument looks deceptively simple because it is so short. Its conclusion is based on a single premise—that incarcerating more criminals will reduce the crime rate. If we recognize the premise as a conditional statement, the argument has the form

Premise: If we incarcerate more criminals, then the crime rate will be reduced.

Conclusion: We should build more prisons.

Viewed this way, the argument hardly makes any sense at all, because the premise says nothing about building prisons. Clearly, the speaker must have intended some hidden assumptions to be “obvious” to the listeners.

We can begin to make sense of the argument by identifying possible hidden assumptions. For example, a plausible argument might look like this:

Hidden Assumption 1: Stated Premise: Hidden Assumption 2: Hidden Assumption 3: Conclusion:

If we build more prisons, then more criminals can be incarcerated.

If we incarcerate more criminals, then the crime rate will be reduced.

If the crime rate is reduced, then we will have a more desirable society.

If a policy will lead to a more desirable society, then it should be enacted.

We should build more prisons.

With the three hidden assumptions, the argument is a long chain of conditionals that is deductively valid. But even if we assume the speaker intended these assumptions to be “obvious,” the argument is sound only if you accept the truth of both the single stated premise and the three hidden assumptions. All are debatable.

For example, many people would argue with the first hidden assumption, because incarcerating more criminals requires not only more prison space, but also a more efficient court system. The stated premise is also open to debate: Studies do not agree on whether a higher incarceration rate reduces the crime rate. One could counter the second hidden assumption by arguing that crime reduction might not make a more desirable society if it comes at the price of less personal freedom. Even the last hidden assumption is debatable, because we might not choose to implement a beneficial policy if it has a high cost.

In summary, the original argument makes sense only if we add several hidden assumptions, and these assumptions are open to debate. As a result, the truth of the conclusion is also debatable.  Now try Exercises 25–28.

hint 3: identify the real issue

It can be difficult to identify the real issue in a debate because people may be attempting to hide their true intentions. Fortunately, by analyzing arguments carefully, we can often determine whether the real issue is hidden, even if we don’t know exactly what it is.

ExAMPLE 3 Banning Concerts

Analyze the following segment of an editorial from a local newspaper.

With last Saturday’s sellout crowd at the Moonlight Amphitheater, it is clear that the parking problem has gotten worse. Concert goers parked along residential streets up to

a mile away from the amphitheater, badly overcrowding sidewalks, blocking driveways,

and disrupting traffic. In light of this parking problem, future concerts should be banned.

Solution The argument makes several claims about parking problems, but stripped of the details the argument boils down to this:

hiSToriCAL NoTE

Can logic settle all arguments? The German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646–1716) thought so and took the first steps in a two-century search for a “calculus

of reasoning.” An outgrowth of this search called symbolic logic is now used extensively in mathematics and computing. But Leibniz’s dream of resolving arguments through logic was not to be. In 1931, the Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel discovered that no system of logic can solve all mathematical problems, let alone problems of ethics or morality.

Premise:

Conclusion:

There is a parking problem for concerts at the theater.

Future concerts at the theater must be banned.

The rest of the argument simply lists reasons why the parking problem is serious. But is a parking problem really a good enough reason to ban all future concerts? After all, a parking problem could have many solutions. For example, it might be possible to create new parking lots, to use shuttle buses, to step up enforcement of parking violations, or to encourage carpooling. The weakness of the argument should make us wonder whether the editorial writers are really concerned about parking or whether they are using this issue to oppose the concerts themselves. Or perhaps they are responding to a few vocal residents who complained about the parking problem. It’s hard to know for sure, but it seems unlikely that parking is the only issue.

 Now try Exercises 29–30.

hint 4: Understand all the Options

We regularly make decisions in situations in which we have several options. For example, we face decisions about which insurance policy to choose, which auto loan to take, or which model of new computer to buy. The key to such decisions is making sure that you understand how each option would affect you.

ExAMPLE 4 Which airline Ticket to Buy?

Airlines typically offer many different prices for the same trip. Suppose you are planning a trip six months in advance and discover that you have two choices in purchasing an airline ticket:

(a) The lowest fare is $400, but 25% of the fare is nonrefundable if you change or cancel the ticket.

(B) A fully refundable ticket is available for $800.

Analyze the situation.

Solution We can think of each of the two options as a pair of conditional propositions. Under option A, you will lose 25% of $400, or $100, if you cancel your trip. That is, option A represents the following pair of conditional propositions:

(1a) If you purchase ticket A and go on the trip, then you will pay $400. (2a) If you purchase ticket A and cancel the trip, then you will pay $100.

Similarly, option B represents the following pair of conditional propositions: (1B) If you purchase ticket B and go on the trip, then you will pay $800.

(2B) If you purchase ticket B and cancel the trip, then you will pay $0.

Figure 1.36 represents the four possibilities. Clearly, option A is the better buy if

you go on the trip, and option B is the better buy if you end up canceling your trip.

However, because you are planning six months in advance, it’s impossible to foresee all

Ticket A

Go Cancel

$400 $100 Ticket B

Go Cancel

$800 $0

Ticket B

Go Canc

$800 $0

the circumstances that might lead you to cancel your trip. Therefore, you might want to analyze the difference between the two tickets under the two possibilities (going on

the trip or canceling).

If you go on the trip: ticket B costs $400 more than ticket A. If you cancel the trip: ticket A costs $100 more than ticket B.



In effect, you must decide which ticket to purchase by balancing the risk of spending an extra $400 if you go on the trip against spending an extra $100 if you cancel. How would you decide?  Now try Exercises 31–35.

Time Out to Think Consider the two ticket options in Example 4 from the point of view of the airline. How does offering the two options help the airline maximize its revenue?

hint 5: Watch for Fine Print and Missing information

There’s an old saying that “the devil is in the details,” and it is probably nowhere more applicable than in the fine print of offers, deals, and contracts. What looks like a great deal without the fine print may be a poor one with it. Worse yet, sometimes even the fine print neglects to state important information. Use your powers of critical thinking to decide what information you need. If anything is missing, be sure to ask before you act.

ExAMPLE 5 a Safe investment?

Marshall was nearing retirement age and was concerned about his retirement savings. He thought the stock market was too risky, so he put his money into a certificate of deposit (CD) at his local bank. Like most CDs, the one at his local bank was federally insured by the F.D.I.C. (which insures bank deposits in the United States), but its interest rate was quite low. Then he heard about this offer:

Our certificates of deposit have the highest interest rates* you’ll find anywhere— more than double that of most other banks! For a combination of investment safety and high interest, there’s no better choice.

*Our high yields come from our unique ability to invest in valuable offshore assets.

Marshall transferred all his savings into one of these high-yield CDs. Two years later, the bank offering these CDs failed, and Marshall learned that he would not be able to recover any of the money he had lost. What happened?

Solution Marshall lost his retirement savings because, unlike most CDs, this one was not insured by the F.D.I.C. Losses like this have affected millions of people in recent years, but these losses could have been avoided with additional thought. First, Marshall should have wondered how one bank could possibly have offered a rate so much higher than that of other banks. Second, the fine print stating that investments were “offshore” should have been a clue to the fact that this was not a normal CD. Third, because the offer did not say that the CD was insured, he should have inquired further before assuming that it was.  Now try Exercise 36.

hint 6: are Other Conclusions Possible?

You should never accept the first argument or choice you hear. Even when an argument proves its conclusion, it’s still possible that there are other unstated conclusions. And remember that many real arguments are inductive, which means the conclusion is never proved no matter how strong the argument may seem.

ExAMPLE 6 nuclear Deterrence

Evaluate the following historical argument, and discuss its conclusion.

The development of nuclear weapons changed the way world leaders think about potential conflicts. A single nuclear weapon can kill millions of people, and the arsenals



of the United States and the Soviet Union contained enough power to kill everyone on Earth many times over. This potential for catastrophic damage led to the idea of nuclear deterrence, which held that the United States and the Soviet Union would be deterred from direct warfare by the fear of nuclear war. For the more than 45 years of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union never did fight directly. This was one of the longest periods in human history during which two major enemies avoided direct war. We can only conclude that nuclear deterrence prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Solution The conclusion of this argument is the claim that nuclear deterrence prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The facts cited in support of this conclusion are all true and all appear relevant to the conclusion, so the argument appears strong. Nevertheless, it does not prove that nuclear deterrence worked, and we can imagine other possible explanations for why the United States and the Soviet Union avoided war. For example, it might have been because of economic factors, the emergence of a united Western Europe after World War II, or changes in nonnuclear weaponry. Indeed, because the argument concerns why history unfolded in a particular way, it is probably impossible for us to ever know for certain whether the conclusion is true or false.

Time Out to Think Can you think of any facts that would tend to undercut the argument that nuclear deterrence prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union? Overall, in your judgment, is the argument in Example 6 convincing? Why or why not?

hint 7: Don’t Miss the Big Picture

You’ve probably heard the expression “not seeing the forest for the trees,” which means missing out on the big picture (the fact that there is a forest in front of you) because you are too focused on details (the individual trees). The details may be very important to a debate or argument, but you should always step back as you consider them to make sure you have not lost sight of the forest.

ExAMPLE 7 Burst of the housing Bubble

Look back at the chapter-opening activity (“Bursting Bubble”) about the collapse in the housing market that helped trigger a global recession. Economists and real estate professionals collected vast amounts of data as home prices rose, so everyone was well aware that prices were increasing at a rapid rate from 2000 to 2005. But people continued to invest in real estate at ever-higher prices, and lenders continued to loan money for those purchases, because so many people convinced themselves that real estate was a “safe” investment. Were these arguments reasonable, or did they miss the big picture?

Solution The data on the home price to income ratio (see the figure on p. 4) suggest that the big picture was missed. Remember that the rise in this ratio that occurred during the housing bubble meant that families had to spend larger percentages of their income on housing, and the only way they could do that was through some combination of higher income, reduced expenses in other areas, and increased borrowing. Other data show that the average income (adjusted for inflation) of working families did not rise during the housing bubble, nor did families cut back significantly on other expenses. It’s therefore reasonable to conclude that many families were buying homes that were more expensive than they could really afford and that lenders were lending them money anyway. In light of this big picture, a significant drop in housing prices seems to have been inevitable.

57–65: Critical Thinking. Consider the following short arguments that support a conclusion (which may only be implied). Use critical thinking methods to analyze the arguments and determine whether the conclusion is convincing. Write out your analysis carefully.
57. Newspapers have been a mainstay of American life for two centuries. However, their very existence is being threatened

by Internet news sources. There is no substitute for newspapers as a local news source. Furthermore, for national issues, citizens need the investigative reporting of trained and independent newspaper journalists, rather than the biased opinions of Internet bloggers.
58. “A free people should be an armed people. It insures against the tyranny of the government. If they know the biggest army is the American people, then you don’t have the tyranny that came from King George.” —Representative Chris Gohmert, Texas
59. “Each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning .... But if you put individuals together in the right way,...you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system.” —Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind
60. “We know that assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines are weapons of choice in contemporary mass shootings. We know that law enforcement officers nationwide are increasingly finding themselves staring down the barrels of assault weapons in the hands of criminals and the dangerous mentally ill. The time has come for action. The enactment of Senator Feinstein’s legislation would be a significant step toward ending the gruesome gun violence that is destroying our families and communities.” —Coalition to Stop Gun Violence
61. “And 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were all cooler than 1998 by a larger margin than 2012 was hotter than 1998. Such is the rigor of many who preen as devotees of science that they declared the 2012 temperatures in the contiguous states (1.58 percent of the Earth’s surface) proof of catastrophic global warming.” —Holman Jenkins and George Will
62. “The President is trying to avoid talking about the real subject that threatens our country—and that’s the debt. ... We have an illusion of wealth, but there is still great danger that we’ll run into another crisis like we did in 2008. The wealth is built from fake money, it’s built from manufacturing
new money to paper over our debt.” —Senator Rand Paul, R-Kentucky
63. “Another difference between airline crashes and asteroid collisions ... is that one can do something about the risk of being killed in an airline crash—not fly or fly less frequently...—and one cannot do anything about asteroid collisions. Yet most people who are afraid to fly substitute another means of transportation, namely driving, that is more dangerous than flying.” —Richard Posner, Catastrophe
64. “There is no universal solution to the problem of decisionmaking. The real world is just too complex. ... Sometimes we need to reason through our options and carefully analyze the possibilities. And sometimes, we need to listen to our
emotions. The secret is knowing when to use these different styles of thought. We always need to be thinking about how we think.” ––Jonah Lehrer, How We Decide
65. “[The N.C.A.A.] investigators regularly solicit the assistance of law enforcement officials, acting as if they have some kind of equal standing. But they don’t. The N.C.A.A. is not a regulatory body. It is merely an association that creates rules designed to prevent its labor force— college football and basketball players—from making any money. Most of its investigations . . . are aimed at enforcing its dubious rules.” —Joe Nocera, New York Times,

66. Poetry and Mathematics. Consider the following poem by the English poet A.E. Housman (1859–1936).
1E Critical Thinking in Everyday Life 65
LOVELIEST OF TREES
Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough
And stands about the woodland ride Wearing white for Eastertide.
Now, of my threescore years and ten, Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score, It only leaves me fifty more.
And since to look at things in bloom Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.
How old was the poet at the time he wrote this poem? (Hint: A score is 20.) Based on your reading of this poem, how much longer does the poet expect to live? Explain.
iN your WorLD
67. interpreting the Second Amendment. Much of the debate over gun control revolves around interpretations of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It reads:
A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Gun rights advocates tend to focus on the “right of the people to keep and bear arms.” Gun control advocates tend to focus on “a well-regulated militia.” Visit a few of the many websites on each side of this issue to find interpretations of the Second Amendment that both support and oppose gun control. Based on what you learn, do you believe that the Second Amendment allows for gun control laws? Defend your opinion.
68. Ballot initiatives. Investigate a particular ballot initiative in your state, county, or city (or choose one in another area from a website). Explain the important arguments on each side of the issue. If possible, find a statement of the initiative as it appeared on the ballot. Is the statement of the initiative clear? Explain.
69. Fine Print. Several websites, including mouseprint.org, give recent examples of deceptive uses of fine print. Describe one case that you think is particularly deceptive or dangerous. Describe the case in detail, and explain how the fine print is important to understanding the situation.
70. Argument Analysis. Find a news article or editorial in which a clear position is taken on a controversial issue. Analyze the argument using the hints and strategies given in this unit. Whether or not you agree with the final conclusion, state whether the argument is effective.
71. Personal Decisions. Discuss a situation in your own life in which you needed to think carefully before making a critical decision. Did you use critical thinking strategies? In retrospect, would you have made a different decision using critical thinking strategies?
72. Ambiguous Terms. Many arguments and promotions are difficult to analyze because of vague, ambiguous, or over-used terms (for example, “natural food” or “human rights”). In news articles or advertising, find three terms that you believe are vague or ambiguous. Explain how the terms could be more clearly defined.

Beware of “Up To” Deals

You’ve probably heard special cell phone offers such as “get up to 1 GB of free data per month.”These offers can be good deals if you are able to take full advantage of them. But the words “up to” hold hidden danger. In this case, the data may be free only during certain hours of the day, or they may not include roaming charges. If you are not careful, this special deal may turn out to be quite expensive.
More generally, you should beware of any deal that contains the words “up to.” For example, an offer of “up to five free oil changes if you pay for two now” may be structured to make it difficult for you to take advantage of all of them. “Up to” may also mean “no more than”; for example, when you hear that you can “earn up to $5000 a month while working from home,” it probably means you’re likely to earn far less. Until you’ve carefully thought through the full meaning of the offer, it’s best to assume that “up to” deals are up to no good.
